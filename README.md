### Welcome to the Chess Store:
#### Once, you have been hired, there are a few helpful hints you will be told on how to be more productive:
1. SHIFT + SPACE works anywhere on the site to search for anything.
2. RIGHT CLICKING will always bring up a nice menu with all of your most important navigation options.
3. If you are working the phone lines and a customer calls to cancel their order, tell them too bad, we don't cancel orders here at the A&M Chess Store
4. If you are working as a manager, your dashboard shows you a list of all items, the number in green is it's current price, the next number is the current warehouse stock, if that number is below the reorder level, it'll be in a red badge.
5. The item page is the main page for adding purchases and changing item prices, if you need to do either of these things, you should have a full knowledge of the item that you are doing it for.
6. If you are working as a shipper, the plus and minus icons can always be used to get more details about what is in the order.
